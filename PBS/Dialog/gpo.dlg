> I have heard rumors about the Aether Foundation's president.

[QUEST_LPBC,1]
/speaker Klaus
> Hello there. Someone came at the perfect time.
> I really need some help.
> I was focused on developing my story in RPG Maker, and the Vulpix that was resting here ran away somewhere.
> It is a special Vulpix from Alola. You can recognize it by its snow-white color.
> A curious thing, Alolan Pokémon... Raised in a different region to become types almost opposite of their usual variants.
> Asking the people in the lounge would probably be a good start to find out where Vulpix went.

[QUEST_LPBC,2]
/speaker Klaus
> Where could you have gone off to...

[QUEST_LPBC,3]
/speaker Klaus
> Please find Vulpix before it gets in trouble!

[QUEST_LPBC,4]

[QUEST_LPBC,7]
/speaker Employee
> An Alolan Vulpix you say?
> I take a break for a couple minutes, and my co-worker already makes an error?
> While relaxing with some coffee, I didn't pay attention to any Vulpix running by.

[QUEST_LPBC,8]
/speaker Employee
> If I have seen an Alolan Vulpix pass by?
> There was one who followed a boy towards the elevator. I assumed it was his Pokémon.
> It's probably somewhere in the Lapis District now.

[QUEST_LPBC,9]

[QUEST_LPBC,14]
> Vulpix is unsure if it is safe to approach you yet.

[QUEST_LPBC,15]
> Vulpix doesn't look to be interested in that anymore.

[QUEST_LPBC,16]
> Vulpix inches closer to you and smells your hand cautiously.

[QUEST_LPBC,17]
> Vulpix sounds quite happy.<br>It will follow you back to Klaus.

[QUEST_LPBC,18]
> Your sudden motion made the Vulpix unsure about you.

[QUEST_LPBC,19]
> Vulpix is too far away for you to stroke its back.

[QUEST_LPBC,20]
> Vulpix became more curious of you and came closer.

[QUEST_LPBC,21]
> Vulpix remains curious about you.

[QUEST_LPBC,22]
> The sound was too loud with Vulpix so close. It distanced itself slightly.

[QUEST_LPBC,23]
/speaker Klaus
> Thank you for finding Vulpix!<br>You were a great help!
> I gave it one of its favorite treats, Big Malasadas, a homemade treat from the Alola region.

> Anyhow, as my beta tester, you should be rewarded as well.
