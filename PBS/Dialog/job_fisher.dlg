> Great! Fishing can be both a relaxing and an intense activity, all depending on what kind of Pokémon you try to hook.
> Here, I'll give you this Fishing Rod, to set you out on your voyage.

[JOB_FISHER_1,2]
/speaker Ivan
> Now that you have a rod, let me explain how to properly hook a fish...

[JOB_FISHER_1,3]
/speaker Ivan
> To begin, why don't you try to hook a Magikarp from the lake outside?
> You don't have to catch the Magikarp with a Pokéball, successfully hooking it is enough to prove yourself.
> If you can do that, I am willing to tutor you into a master fisherman.

> Try hooking a Magikarp in the lake outside. If you can do that, I am willing to tutor you into a master fisherman.

[JOB_FISHER_1,5]
/speaker Ivan
> You hooked a Magikarp? Good going!

[JOB_FISHER_1,6]
/speaker Ivan
> I'll let you keep that rod, and if you can prove you have raised your skill level, I'll teach you some new techniques.
> For your next challenge, I want you to try hooking two different Pokémon.

[JOB_FISHER_1,7]
> \ts[2]You got the job as a Fisher!
> \ts[1]You can track the Pokémon Ivan requested you to hook in the Trainer menu.

[JOB_FISHER_2,0]
/speaker Ivan
> I hope your fishing adventures are going well. Do you remember what Pokémon I tasked you to hook?

[JOB_FISHER_2,1]
/speaker Ivan
> The first Pokémon is Seaking, which as you might guess, can be found at sea.
> The second Pokémon is Poliwhirl. You're more likely to find that one in a lake somewhere.
> You will have to figure out where to find them yourself, though the Habitat Dex I've heard is in development would help.
> I believe someone at the G[.]P[.]O[.] could hook you up with it, even though it's still in development.
> I've heard the fishing encounter list in the Habitat Dex even shows what Pokémon you have previously hooked.
