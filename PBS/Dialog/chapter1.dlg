/speaker Amethyst
/hidename 1

/expression awkward
> Ehm, I don't think that's a good idea.
/expression worried
> We got an anonymous report that told of someone being lost, maybe even unconscious, deep in the woods.
> The Evergone Mangrove is home to many wild Pokémon. It can be very dangerous.
/expression neutral
> That's why I'm here on a solo mission, to more easily avoid being spotted by the wild Pokémon.
/speaker Duke
