/speaker Amethyst
> Have you had a good look into her condition?
/speaker Nurse
> We have, but I cannot say we understand much.
> Her condition is definitely stable, but the test results show the complete opposite of what is considered normal.
> We have never seen a case like this. I am sorry we cannot be of more help.
/speaker Amethyst
> Thank you for your effort either way! The important thing is that she's okay.
/speaker Nurse
> It's unlikely that we will be able to discern anything else really, so we can discharge her.
> Though to keep an eye on her, I think it would be best to let her stay at the living quarters for a while.
/speaker Amethyst
> That sounds like a good idea. We can bring her along and show her where she'll be staying.
> Does that sounds okay with you?
/speaker Nekane
/hidename 1

/speaker Nekane
/hidename 1
> \ts[2]Questions? What questions?
/speaker Amethyst
> \ts[1]We kinda found you in the middle of nowhere, so just some simple questions about you.
/speaker Nekane
> \ts[2]About... me? I think that is... fine?
/speaker Amethyst

/speaker Nekane

/expression confused

/speaker Nekane
/hidename 1
> \ts[2]Hmm... I guess that is true. But if I have no name, what happens then?
/speaker Amethyst awkward
> \ts[1]That's a... unique predicament.
/expression neutral
> I guess we'll just have to come up with a name then!
> Any ideas <PLAYER>?

[CH2_NEKANE,6]

> Do you know anything about what happened in the Evergone Mangrove and why you were there?
/speaker Nekane thought
> ...
/expression neutral
> \ts[2]Sorry. I cannot seem recall anything about that forest.
> The only thing I remember is a large shadow of some kind...
/speaker Amethyst confused
> \ts[1]A large shadow..?\nThat's not a lot to work with.
/expression neutral
> But if you really can't remember anything else, we won't trouble you anymore. At least not until you remember something.
